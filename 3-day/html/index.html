    <h2> Sobre Mí. </h2>

    <p>
        Mi nombre es Mateo, tengo 19 años. mi correo es <a
            href="mailto:mateo.pineda.be@gmail.com">mateo.pineda.be@gmail.com </a>.
        Estoy estudiando una técnica en desarrollo de software y me gustaría especializarme en la parte BackEnd del
        desarrollo.
        Uno de mis hobbies es la escritura y lectura, además de escuchar música todo el tiempo.
        Sin embargo, también he estado desarrollando independientemente algunas <strong>Novelas Visuales</strong> que
        tengo en etapa de borrador aún. 👨🏻‍💻
        El propósito de éste documento es únicamente explorar el cómo me siento con mi poema favorito. Además
        de que <em>intentaré</em>
        utilizar todas las etiquetas que he ido aprendiendo a lo largo de éstos días.
        Empezando por uno de mis poemas favoritos: <i lang="en">The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock </i>
    </p>

            <i>
            S’io credesse che mia risposta fosse
            A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,
            Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.
            Ma percioche giammai di questo fondo
            Non torno vivo alcun, s’i’odo il vero,
            Senza tema d’infamia ti rispondo.
            </i>
            Let us go then, you and I,
            When the evening is spread out against the sky
            Like a patient etherized upon a table;
            Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
            The muttering retreats
            Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
            And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
            Streets that follow like a tedious argument
            Of insidious intent
            To lead you to an overwhelming question ...

            Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”
            Let us go and make our visit.

            In the room the women come and go
            Talking of Michelangelo.

            The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
            The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
            Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
            Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
            Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
            Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
            And seeing that it was a soft October night,
            Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

            And indeed there will be time
            For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
            Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
            There will be time, there will be time
            To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
            There will be time to murder and create,
            And time for all the works and days of hands
            That lift and drop a question on your plate;
            Time for you and time for me,
            And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
            And for a hundred visions and revisions,
            Before the taking of a toast and tea.

            In the room the women come and go
            Talking of Michelangelo.

            And indeed there will be time
            To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”
            Time to turn back and descend the stair,
            With a bald spot in the middle of my hair —
            (They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)
            My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
            My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin —
            (They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)
            Do I dare
            Disturb the universe?
            In a minute there is time
            For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

            For I have known them all already, known them all:
            Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
            I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
            I know the voices dying with a dying fall
            Beneath the music from a farther room.
            So how should I presume?

            And I have known the eyes already, known them all—
            The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
            And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
            When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
            Then how should I begin
            To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
            And how should I presume?

            And I have known the arms already, known them all—
            Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
            (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
            Is it perfume from a dress
            That makes me so digress?
            Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
            And should I then presume?
            And how should I begin?

            Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
            And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
            Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...

            I should have been a pair of ragged claws
            Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

            And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
            Smoothed by long fingers,
            Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
            Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
            Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
            Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
            But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
            Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
            I am no prophet — and here’s no great matter;
            I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
            And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
            And in short, I was afraid.

            And would it have been worth it, after all,
            After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
            Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
            Would it have been worth while,
            To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
            To have squeezed the universe into a ball
            To roll it towards some overwhelming question,
            To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
            Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”—
            If one, settling a pillow by her head
            Should say: “That is not what I meant at all;
            That is not it, at all.”

            And would it have been worth it, after all,
            Would it have been worth while,
            After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
            After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—
            And this, and so much more?—
            It is impossible to say just what I mean!
            But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
            Would it have been worth while
            If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
            And turning toward the window, should say:
            “That is not it at all,
            That is not what I meant, at all.”

            No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
            Am an attendant lord, one that will do
            To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
            Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
            Deferential, glad to be of use,
            Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
            Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
            At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—
            Almost, at times, the Fool.

            I grow old ... I grow old ...
            I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

            Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?
            I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
            I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

            I do not think that they will sing to me.

            I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
            Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
            When the wind blows the water white and black.
            We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
            By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
            Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

        Aquel poema, <i lang="en">The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</i> proviene del libro de T.S Elliot, <i
            lang="en">Collected Poems</i>, escrito alrededor de 110 años atrás en inglaterra.
        El poema refleja los complejos sentimientos del protagonista ante los acontecimientos de su vida y sus
        relaciones con las mujeres.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
        <b>Personalmente</b> considero que este poema podría centrarse en cómo Prufrock representa a muchas personas
        que,
        a pesar de tener anhelos profundos y aspiraciones, se sienten paralizadas por la inseguridad y la percepción del
        tiempo
        que se escapa. La repetición de preguntas y la constante búsqueda de validación resuenan en nuestra propia
        experiencia,
        donde a menudo nos encontramos cuestionando nuestras decisiones y nuestro lugar en el mundo.
